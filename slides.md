# Journey of Concurrency
    
## Need of concurrency
    * To utilise the CPU properly
    * To full-fill the need of modern application
        <v-click>
          * High throughput
          * Low latency
        </v-click>

## Evolution   
    * Parallel vs concurrent processes 
    * Processes and threads
    * Multi-threading
    * Asyncrounous

# thread-per-request style
    Pros:
        * Easy to understand and program
        * Easy to debug and profile
        * it uses the platform's unit of concurrency to represent the application's unit of concurrency
    Cons:
        * The scalability of server application is governed by Little's law
            * L(throughput) = 𝜆(concurrent request) * W(latenncy)
            * 200(request per second) = 10 * 50ms
            * 2000(request per second) = ?
            * 2000(request per second) = 100(concurrent request) * 50ms
        * No of threads needs to increase to keepup with this throughput

# Limitations of native threads
    * Each native thread is mapped to corresponding kernel thread
    * Creating a new thread is a heavy operation
    * The default stack size is 512Kb on 32 bit and 1Mb for 64bit OS
    * Context switching is heavy - this increases as no of threads increases
    * So, The JDK' caps the application's throughput to a level well below 
      what the hardware can support

---
transition: fade-out
---

# Asynchronous style
    * Returns thread to a pool when it waits for I/O operation to complete
    * Can achieve high number of concurrent operation w/o consuming high no of threads
    * But it come with higher price:
        * Learning curve for async style 
        * Increases verbosity - for e.g reactive programing
        * Stack trace provides no usable context
        * Debugging and profiling becomes hard
        * the application's unit of concurrency  is no longer the platform's unit of concurrency.

# So, Virtual Threads:
    * Uses, thread-per-request style more efficiently 
    * JVM handles the lifecycle and scheduling
    * Can achive same scale as asyncrounous style but more transparently 
    * Cheap to creat and almost infinitely plentiful
    * Does not require learning new concepts

# How to create?

```ts {all|1|4|1-8|9|all}
try (var executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
    IntStream.range(0, 10_000).forEach(i -> {
        executor.submit(() -> {
            Thread.sleep(Duration.ofSeconds(1));
            return i;
        });
    });
} 
```
